# Debloat Windows 11 â€“ KYZR
A robust Powershell pacakage with custom module that makes some QOL changes to Windows 11 (x64, 22H2+)
Removes dozens of bloatware packages and disables some content delivery systems to prevent Windows from re-installing them automatically.

Shoutout to Creosynth for mentioning me in their "Open source Windows tweakers" discussion threads for the inspiration to revive this project.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
